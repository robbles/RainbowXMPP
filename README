== RainbowXMPP

This is a simple Rails app that lets you send color information to Turk Devices using the new Turk protocol with XMPP.

== Getting Started

1. First make sure you have all the right gems. This one requires XMPP4R and Haml. sudo gem install git://github.com/ln/xmpp4r.git
2. Next, make sure you have a Jabber account.
3. Change directory into the application to 'vendor/drb_scripts'. Change the 'from' in the config.yml file to match your Jabber account.
4. Next run the XMPP script using 'ruby basic_drb.rb'
5. Now its time to run the Rails App. First go the 'app/controllers/colors_controller'. Edit line 10 to match the destination of your device's account.
6. Go to the root directory of the application and start the server with "ruby script/server"
7. Go http://localhost:3000 to view the app


== Extra

This is a Turk Innovations doodle for Turk developers. Use at your own peril.
